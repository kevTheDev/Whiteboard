the demo
"Argh, calculus is so hard. I need help with this problem."
1. meebo: start describing math problem
   - I need to find the volume of a... like a shifted half-cone
   - what?
   - let me draw this
"Whiteboard is for people who think visually."
2. open whiteboard
   - create board
   - name "volume integral"
"I'm giving my friend a link so he can watch as I draw."
3. meebo: send public viewing link
4. draw figure (see reference rendering)
5. chat
   - so yeah, half cone
   - I know how to do this
6. create new layer "solution"
"Now I'll give him his own layer where he can write the solution."
7. meebo: send "solution" layer link
8. helper writes integral (see reference rendering)
"Try typing that in an instant message. Hm, let me see if I understand this."
9. chat
   - so this is the cross sectional area
10. draw yellow over integrand (see reference rendering)
"Oops, I have to rearrange the layers for this to work."
11. swap layer order (so yellow is behind solution)
12. chat
   - (helper) yes
   - ok, thanks
"Great, I'm all set on my math homework."
13. write chapter and problem number
"I bet the other math students were wondering about this too."
14. hit Publish
15. exit, switch


"I don't want to do my homework. Is there anything good online?"
16. open whiteboard
   - go to gallery
   - click the entry we just made
"Oh my, this looks interesting."
17. comment "thanks, I didn't know which axis to use"
18. hit Like
