You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^there is a whiteboard with id (\d+)$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I am the owner of the whiteboard$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I press the checkbox of one layer$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see that layer$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I follow  "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^I am collaborating on a whiteboard$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I draw a line$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^the whiteboard should be updated$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When /^I fill out "([^"]*)" with "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1, arg2|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
