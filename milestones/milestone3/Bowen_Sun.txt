I am checking out the "RideShare Organizer". This looks like a pretty useful app. 
I notice that they made vehicle a separate model, that's interesting because I 
can't think of any important reason to make vehicle a separate entity (besides
the fact that different vehicle has different capacity as they indicated in their
app). One cool feature about this app is their Google Map API. On the sign-up page, 
it automatically generate possible addresses as I type. I am not sure how they 
implement this feature because I don't see any Google Map API code in the new.html.erb
in the registration views. I checked the form partial of the "create_new_trip" page, but 
I still only saw "f.label :address".
