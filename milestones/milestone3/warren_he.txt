I'm the frontend guy for our team, so I chose a frontend feature. The first cool frontend feature I found was use of the geolocation API in Enchantee. The code that does this is a piece of Javascript in the new users page. It calls the API's getCurrentLocation method, giving it a callback. The callback receives the position and sets the lat/lon hidden fields in the user creation form.
